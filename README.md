# üìÇ Initial Setup
Create a project folder** (e.g., `Whats_Game`) on your Desktop or any preferred location.  


# üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions
```bash
1. Set Up Virtual Environment (venv)
Navigate to your project folder and create a virtual environment:

cd ~/Desktop/Whats_Game          # Or your custom path
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\...     # Or your custom path (Windows)

python3 -m venv venv             # Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv              # Create virtual environment (Windows)

source venv/bin/activate         # macOS
venv\Scripts\activate            # Windows
After activation, your terminal prompt should show (venv).



2. Install Dependencies
<BASH>
pip3 install jaraco.text pygame py2app  # macOS
pip install pygame py2app               # Windows
‚ö†Ô∏è Windows users, please use main_win.py and rename it to main.py by removing the _win suffix.


3. Test the Game
<BASH>
python3 main.py  # macOS
python main.py   # Windows

‚ö†Ô∏è If you encounter the error pygame.error: Unsupported image format on Windows:
Cause: PNG files generated on macOS may use an incompatible format.
Fix: Open the problematic image(s) in an editor (e.g., Paint, Photoshop, GIMP) and re-save them as PNG.
Use Pre-fixed Images (Recommended):
Download the images_win folder (included in this project) and overwrite the files in the images folder with the Windows-compatible versions.



4. Build macOS/Windows Executable
<BASH>
python3 setup.py py2app       # macOS
The app bundle will be generated in dist/Whats.app.
‚ö†Ô∏è For ARM64, use the file setup.py_ARM64 and For x64, use the file setup.py_x64.
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Before using, remove "_ARM64" or "_x64" from the filename, keeping only setup.py


Windows Packaging Instructions
To create a standalone .exe file using PyInstaller, run the following command in Command Prompt:

pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed ^
  --add-data "images;images" ^
  --add-data "sounds;sounds" ^
  --add-data "appicon.ico;." ^
  --icon "C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\Whats_game\appicon.ico" ^
  --name Whats ^
  main.py
‚ö†Ô∏è No icon in the .exe? Change the filename to bypass cache.



5. Create DMG (macOS Only)
First, install create-dmg (if needed):

<BASH>
brew install create-dmg
cd ~/Desktop/Whats_Game    # Or your custom path

<BASH>
create-dmg \
  --volname "Whats 1.0.1" \
  --volicon "appicon.icns" \
  --window-pos 200 120 \
  --window-size 500 300 \
  --icon-size 100 \
  --icon "Whats.app"    100 100 \
  --icon "CREDITS.txt"  250 100 \
  --hide-extension "Whats.app" \
  --hide-extension "CREDITS.txt" \
  --app-drop-link 400 100 \
  "../Whats_1.0.1.dmg" \
  "dist/"



Creating an Installer (Windows Only)
